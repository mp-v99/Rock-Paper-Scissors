# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Hello world!  Welcome to my [Rock-Paper-Scissors](https://mp-v99.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors/ "This is the live preview") project. 

FIRST VERSION: 

The first version consists of applying my newly acquired knowledge of functions to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against a machine. 

The getComputerChoice will use the Math.random method to return one of the three options(rock, paper or scissors) 

The getHumanChoice function will take input from the user to return of the three options as well. 

The score variables, of course, keep track of both pc and player's scores. 

The Round function compares the values returned by getHumanChoice and getComputerChoice to determine who's 
the winner.     

The playGame function runs a loop than counts 5 iterations and, in the end, compares the scores to determine who won and then logs a message depending on the winner.
