# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Hello world!  Welcome to my Rock-Paper-Scissors project. 

FIRST VERSION: 

The first version consists of applying my newly acquired knowledge of functions to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against a machine. 

The getComputerChoice will use the Math.random method to return one of the three options(rock, paper or scissors) 

The getHumanChoice function will take input from the user to return of the three options as well.
